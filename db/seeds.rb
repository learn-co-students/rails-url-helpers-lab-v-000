# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Student.create([{first_name: 'Anna', last_name: 'Homen'}, {first_name: 'Ashley', last_name: 'Schultz'}])
